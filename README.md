# üçú Pangea - AI-Powered Food Delivery Coordination

**Pangea** is an innovative AI-powered food delivery coordination system designed for college campuses. It uses Claude 4 (Anthropic's latest AI model) to act as an "AI Friend" that helps students find lunch buddies and save money on delivery fees through intelligent group ordering.

## üéØ Project Concept

### The Problem
College students often want to order food but face high delivery fees when ordering alone. Finding friends with similar food preferences and timing can be challenging and time-consuming.

### The Solution
Pangea creates an AI Friend for each user that:
- **Matches** users with similar restaurant preferences and timing
- **Negotiates** group formations between AI Friends representing different users
- **Coordinates** the entire ordering process via SMS
- **Manages** group payments and pickup logistics
- **Learns** and adapts to each user's preferences over time

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

- **LangGraph Workflow**: Orchestrates complex conversation flows using Anthropic's recommended patterns
- **Multi-Agent Negotiation**: AI Friends negotiate on behalf of their users
- **Intelligent Matching**: Uses Claude 4's reasoning to find compatible users
- **SMS Interface**: Handles all user communication through Twilio
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously learns from user interactions and improves performance

#### 2. **Order Processing System** (`pangea_order_processor.py`)

## üß† AI Learning Capabilities & Code Implementation

The learning system is implemented through several key functions in `pangea_main.py`:

### 1. **Memory Storage & Retrieval**
- **`get_user_preferences()` [Lines 98-127]**: Retrieves stored user data including:
  - Food preferences and favorite cuisines
  - Successful matches history
  - Preferred times and locations
  - Satisfaction scores from past orders

- **`update_user_memory()` [Lines 684-753]**: Stores new interaction data including:
  - Interaction type (successful_group_order, no_matches_found, etc.)
  - Restaurant, location, timing preferences
  - Group members and satisfaction scores
  - AI-generated insights from `extract_learning_insights()`

### 2. **AI-Powered Insight Extraction**
- **`extract_learning_insights()` [Lines 754-780]**: Uses Claude 4 to analyze interactions and extract:
  - Food preference updates (what they liked/disliked)
  - Timing insights (when they prefer to eat)
  - Social preferences (group size, compatibility patterns)
  - Price sensitivity patterns
  - Communication style preferences

### 3. **Historical Compatibility Learning**
- **`check_historical_compatibility()` [Lines 461-476]**: Checks if users have successfully ordered together before and returns perfect compatibility score (1.0) if they have

### 4. **Negotiation Strategy Learning**
- **`negotiate_with_other_ai()` [Lines 501-573]**: Uses target user's history to:
  - Access their preferences via `get_user_preferences()`
  - Generate personalized negotiation reasoning
  - Calculate success probability based on historical patterns

### 5. **Personalized Communication**
- **`enhance_message_with_context()` [Lines 657-683]**: Adapts message tone and content based on:
  - User's past interactions and preferences
  - Communication style patterns
  - Previous satisfaction scores

### 6. **Success Pattern Recognition**
- **`update_user_memory()`** stores successful patterns when satisfaction_score >= 7:
  - Restaurant preferences that worked well
  - Optimal group sizes for each user
  - Timing patterns that led to successful orders
  - Location preferences and success rates

### 7. **Learning Data Structure (Firebase Collections)**
- **`users` collection**: Stores per-user learning data
  - `preferences`: Learned food/timing/location preferences
  - `successful_matches`: History of successful group formations
  - `interactions`: Array of all interactions with AI insights
  - `successful_patterns`: Patterns that led to high satisfaction
  - `satisfaction_scores`: Historical satisfaction ratings

- **`negotiations` collection**: Stores negotiation attempts for learning
  - `target_user_preferences`: Used to improve future negotiations
  - `ai_reasoning`: Claude 4's reasoning for each negotiation
  - Success/failure outcomes for pattern recognition

- **`completed_orders` collection**: Stores successful orders for compatibility learning
  - `participants`: Users who successfully ordered together
  - Used by `check_historical_compatibility()` for future matching

## üîÑ How It Works

### 1. User Onboarding
- New users receive a welcome message explaining the system
- AI Friend learns their preferences over time

### 2. Food Request
- User texts their food preference (e.g., "I want Thai food at Student Union")
- AI Friend extracts restaurant, location, and timing preferences

### 3. Smart Matching
- System searches for compatible users in the database
- Uses deterministic logic + AI reasoning for compatibility scoring
- Finds users with similar preferences and timing
- **Learning**: Remembers successful combinations for future matching

### 4. Multi-Agent Negotiation
- AI Friends negotiate on behalf of their users
- Propose alternatives, timing adjustments, and incentives
- Reach consensus on restaurant, time, and group composition
- **Learning**: Improves negotiation strategies based on success rates

### 5. Group Formation
- Once group is formed, all members receive order instructions
- Each user places individual order with restaurant
- System coordinates payment collection and pickup
- **Learning**: Stores successful patterns for future reference

### 6. Order Coordination
- Users provide order confirmation numbers
- System manages group payment via Stripe
- Coordinates pickup logistics for the group
- **Learning**: Analyzes satisfaction and updates user preferences

## üéØ Use Cases
